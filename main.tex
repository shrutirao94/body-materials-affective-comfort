% HBI and Built Env
Human building interaction (HBI) is a burgeoning area of research that focuses on capturing, understanding and enhancing human interactions and experiences both with and within ``smart built environments" \cite{alavi2016future}. The primary goal of HCI being a framework that can be used to understand, compare, and converge research efforts from the fields of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), design, and Architecture in envisioning and shaping the future of living spaces and all that they encompass \cite{nembrini2017human, alavi2018artifacts}. 

HBI defines dimensions of comfort, emotions, behaviour, and awareness that impact humans while the dimensions of quality, usability, efficiency and privacy impact the built environments themselves. Interrelations between these dimensions reflect the complexity of the problem in HBI.

% Comfort and Affect in Built Environment
A significant aspect of human experience within built environments is derived from the physical and mental comfort of the occupants \cite{alavi2017comfort}. Occupants' comfort as a result of the built environment focuses on the physiological responses of occupants to environmental factors of thermal, visual, air quality and sound. Moreover, occupants emotions play a role in occupants perception of comfort and consequently their awareness and behaviour within a space. Given that people spend a significant amount of time within built spaces, designing spaces considering the impact that it may have on occupants’ comfort is an important challenge for HBI. 

The interactive experience and perception of physical and emotional comfort can be obtained through materiality
tailored to such spaces that elicit mental and physical experiences such as comfort, social engagement, privacy,
motivation etc - sentiments moods all associated with hybrid learning spaces. Through our building walk and emotion
and comfort label collection, we aim to (among other goals) identify specific, artifacts both tangible and intangible and
the specific properties of the artifacts that impact building occupants and therefore needs rethinking, redesign such
that they may serve as catalysts for human comfort and mental health and well being


% Materialism in Built env (position)
In this position paper, we consider the materiality of space (of a built environment) that encapsulates both tangible artifacts (for eg., hardware, construction elements, furniture, etc.) and non-tangiable artifacts (for eg smell, sound, touch and temperature). We posit that materiality of smart built environments need to be designed in a manner that positively influences occupants subjective affective states, and therefore their perception of comfort towards a more sustainable living. 



% we posit that the smart built environments en both physical-tangible artifacts (for eg., furniture, hardware) and non-tangiable, non-touchable materials for eg., smell, sound, sight, and temperature. Therefore, it is important to extend the definition of an occupant's comfort to not only include their physiological responses to tangiable artefacts but also the non-tangiable space that is the built environment. 



\section{Background}
\todo[inline,color=pink]{tbd}

The design of engaging interaction scenarios varies at least in four directions: a) "Ludic Design"–creating a medium for occupants to become curious, exploratory, and refective with their environments and become thoughtful on how to
make changes [16], b) "Optimally Informative"–making aware IEQ
measurements through the most comprehensible and accessible
means [10, 20, 21, 26, 30, 48, 52], c) "Gamifed"–linking with social
inclusiveness to strike a better connection between occupants’ comfort and ofce activities [28], d) "General awareness"–pursuing a
long-term impact on users via educational or peripheral communication [22, 44].

\section{Designing for Affective Comfort in Hybrid Learning Spaces}

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Why does physical and mental comfort matter in built environments ie the hybrid learning space}

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Proposed case study}
We wish to design learning spaces that can increase an occupant's subjective, affective comfort in hybrid learning spaces. As part of this objective our first step is to identify occupants experiences of comfort and emotions that arise from interactions within the built space - that is to identify the most influential factors (both tangialble and in-tangiable) that determine the overall sense of comfort in hybrid learning spaces. For this we are  conducting a case study to establish the discourse of the language of emotion and comfort in built learning environments. The case study comprises two phases: (a) broad emotion and comfort label collection, and (b) building walk. 

\subsubsection{Phase I: Emotion and Comfort Label collection}
The goal of this phase twofold: (a) obtain a large number of emotion labels from occupants and users of Lab42, and (b) recruit neurotypicals and neurodiverse who are familiar with Lab42 for the involved building walk study. QR codes will be placed around diverse working, and relaxation spaces in the building. Upon scanning the code, users will have to answer two main questions - (a) pertaining to emotions (b) pertaining to comfort. The emotion question would ask “How does this space make you feel?”. Next, users will be asked to reflect upon their comfort in the space “Are you comfortable in this space? Consider things such as temperature, light, noises etc.”. Both questions have an open-ended response format.

\subsubsection{Phase II: Building Walk}
The goal of the building walk is to have a more in-depth understanding of occupants assessment - mental, emotional and physical towards the spaces in LAB42. Phase one focuses on vocabulary while Phase two focuses on context surrounding the perception of emotions and comfort. The building walk comprises three main sessions - (a) a pre-walk briefing session, (b) walking session, and (c) post-walk session. Participants in small groups will be lead by researchers along a pre-planned route of the building (route planned by the participants). During the route, researchers engage participants in conversations about each space marked on the blueprints. Conversation  prompts include asking about impressions of the space (what is your first impression of this space? ), usage of space (How would you use this space? Why do you use this space? What kind of tasks would you perform in this space?), emotions in the space (How do you feel in this space emotionally? OR What emotions do you associate with this space? ), comfort (Is this space comfortable?	Is there sufficient light, warmth, ventilation?). Participants will also be encoraged to take polaroid photos of elements and artifacts that stabnd out to them. 

\subsubsection{Analysis}
Emotion and comfort data collected from Phase I will be analysed using Desmet et al., lexcial analysis methodology to identify and extract comfort and emotion labels. The text from building walk will be also analysed using thematic analysis and used to support the emotion labels collected from the phase 1. Additional context to emotion and comfort labels will also be obtained from the detailed text descriptions.

\todo[inline, color=yellow]{Expected outcomes from study}
\subsubsection{Expected Contributions}
Identification of artifacts that can impact comfort and emotions in a hybrid learning space. 

\todo[inline,color=yellow]{How the outcomes/findings can inform BxM}

Signals from different sensory modalities, such as sounds [54], haptic [23], visual [23], smell [4], taste
and texture stimuli [37] can be used to transform embodied experiences, which in turn may impact on motor, social and
emotional functioning. We aim to address how materiality can transform (i.e., enhance, empower, amplify or augment) people’s perceptions of bodies given the built space and understand the relation between AI, materiality and people’s comfort in hybrid learning environments. 

The interactive experience and perception of physical and emotional comfort can be obtained through materiality tailored to such spaces that elicit mental and physical experiences such as comfort, social engagement, privacy, motivation etc - sentiments moods all associated with hybrid learning spaces.  Through our building walk and emotion and comfort label collection, we aim to (among other goals) identify specific, artifacts both tangible and intangible and the specific properties of the artifacts that impact building occupants and therefore needs rethinking, redesign such that they may serve as catalysts for human comfort and mental health and well being. 





\section{Conclusion}
\todo[inline,color=green!20!white]{Conclusion}
Given the inevitable growth of smarter built environments, we postulate and propose solutions to address potential issues, such that these built environments may be designed keeping in mind the subjective emotional and physical comfort of occupants and learners towards more human-centric, buildings.
