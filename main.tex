In the digital era of architecture, materials and materiality which are closely related to architectural spaces have changed in their usage and how they interact with humans. Intelligent technologies combined with novel materials and design practices in buildings have created unfamiliar human-architecture experiences that remain relatively unexplored. In this position paper, we offer the view of reviewing architecture in the digital age through the lens of HCI and material experiences framework. We argue that such an approach may be better suited for architecture to understand how materials of today may be used to provide and shape novel human experiences. To that end, we describe our ongoing case study within a smart building to understand how occupants perceive, experience and interact with different spaces in the building. Our findings may aid in understanding subjective human-material experiences within smart buildings that can serve as cues for designing experience-enabling materials in architecture.

\section{Introduction}
% Architecture of the digital era
Digital technologies and sustainability sciences are changing the landscape of architecture, and enabling buildings into thoughtful, sustainable and interactive spaces  \cite{kolarevic2004architecture}. Moreover, with digital interactivity becoming a design requirement, ``smart built environments" are a natural next step for architecture. 

% Materials in Architecture
Throughout the discourse of architecture, materials have been considered the language and expression of buildings \cite{schropfer2012material}. However, advancements in technology have dramatically enhanced material capabilities that can now be used to simulate, infer, inform and even create \cite{schropfer2012material, kolarevic2004architecture}. This has resulted in questioning the role of materials in contemporary architectural practices, and how they can be conceived, designed, and produced. 

% Role of humans (body) in architecture and materials
The human body lies at the intersection of architecture and materials that coalesce to interact with the human. The changing nature of materials and therefore the spaces that encompass them may create unfamiliar and novel human-human and human-building interactions that warrant further exploration. These smart buildings present an opportunity for human-computer interaction (HCI) research to bridge the gap between intelligent designs, architecture and human needs in such built environments \cite{nembrini2017human}.  

% position
As the relationship between human and architecture enables for a new way of sensory perception of spaces, in this position paper we consider an HCI-based approach on materials and materiality. We posit that architecture in the digital age should be examined through the lens of the material experiences framework. We believe that architecture can benefit from understanding how materials in smart buildings may be used to provide and shape novel human-building and human-human experiences  \cite{giaccardi2015foundations, thomas2006material}. 

% % paper outline
% We next provide relevant background on architecture in the digital age and the material expressions framework. The remainder of this paper then describes our case study as a first step towards understanding the role of materiality of artefacts in architecture, and the contributions our findings can make towards occupant experiences derived from materials in smart buildings.


\section{Background}
% Buildings in the digital age
Architecture in the digital era envisions its role as a communicative tool that can shape the way of perceiving and thinking using an aggregation of materials in a novel fashion \cite{kolarevic2001designing}. In this context, there are several works that try to combine the material with the immaterial (digital) based on the environment. Smart building facades for example are being developed that adapt to the external environment and react in an energy efficient manner \cite{ahmed2015development}. There are also several works that look at providing comfort to users using responsive materials that react to temperature, light, humidity and air quality \cite{fragkia2020exergy, holstov2015hygromorphic, kroner1997intelligent}. 

% Material Experiences Framework
On the other hand, materials that can shape digital and physical interactions have encouraged human-computer interaction (HCI) research to formalise material experiences. The materials experience framework by Giaccardi and Karana (2015) describes \textit{people}, \textit{practises} and \textit{materials} as three central themes. The framework describe how these three concepts interact to form \textit{relationships}  (encounters,collaborations, and performances) at different \textit{experiential levels} (sensorial, interpretive, affective and performative) \cite{giaccardi2015foundations}. 

% Our perspective
As architectural practises of today show a clear indication of incorporating materials to blend digital experiences with buildings, we wish to examine the relationship between such materials and occupants' experiences in the building following the materials expressions framework. We find it imperative to understand how materials can shape different subjective occupant experiences in architectural spaces.


% Comfort in Architecture
% The concept of comfort is central to occupants within built environments. Comfort is understood as occupants' physiological and affective (emotional) responses to the built environment \cite{alavi2017comfort}. HBI especially examines the relationship between occupant comfort and four physical characteristics of the indoor environment - temperature, air, light, and sound \cite{hawkes2007environmental, bluyssen2009indoor}. 



\section{Towards Material Experiences for Architecture in the Digital Age}
% Why should we design keeping in mind materiality?
A significant consequence of smart buildings is that occupants find themselves physically immersed within a digital space, and therefore experience interactions in a novel, multi-sensory manner \cite{nembrini2017human}. We believe that the materials experience framework may serve as a human-centric tool to understand the relationship between materials and occupants at different experiential levels (sensorial, affective, interpretive and performative) within smart buildings \cite{giaccardi2015foundations}. For instance, different tangible and intangible materials in buildings can be utilised to shape the ways in which occupants perceive and experience the building spaces. Moreover, occupant interactions with non-digital elements of the building remain a challenge in HCI and architecture \cite{nembrini2017human}. Carefully designed materials and thereby their experiences can be used to play a more ubiquitous role in fostering occupants' interactions with non-digital elements of the building through digital means.
 

\subsection{A Digital Building of the Present}
\label{subsec:building}
Our motivation to understand the ``human-building-material" interaction comes from occupying and experiencing one such digital building that houses students, researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. The building labelled as an ``intelligent hub" was designed with a very specific architectural vision to be sustainable, circular and flexible, healthy, and inspiring \footnote{https://lab42.uva.nl/}. To that end, different artefacts in the interior and exterior have been designed using a variety of materials and design features. The building facade itself comprises a pattern of open and closed panels that converge towards the top of the building, referencing a binary code. On the inside, wooden laminated beams contrast floors of recycled concrete. The building aims to encourage communication on the lower floors - a glass atrium is used to indicate the feeling of transparency to occupants who can view all ongoing activities of the building. A colourful plinth is designed to make occupants feel curious and stimulate meeting and collaboration. Quiet and concentration in the upper zones are indicated by recycled felt fashioned into panels and inner walls to promote acoustics. A combination of intelligent sensors throughout the building control light, temperature, and air quality to provide for comfort based on the available number of occupants, and environmental conditions.

\caption{Materials in a smart building that raise questions about its nature and the type of experience it provides to the buildings occupants.} \label{fig:lab42-examples}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:lab42-examples} shows four tangible artefacts in the building designed to provide experiences using a combination of design and materials. However, the employed materials raise questions about the nature of their role in interacting with the building occupants. We speculate on these occupant interactions and experiences by applying the different levels of the materials experiences framework.

\subsubsection*{The Privacy Curtains}
Figures \ref{fig:curtain} and \ref{fig:curtain-sheer} show curtains around workspaces designed to encourage concentration. The curtains themselves invoke an immediate association with privacy around the workspace (\textit{sensorial level}). However, upon further examination, the sheer material instils a feeling of transparency (\textit{interpretive level}). Therefore, the clash between the concept of privacy and a sheer curtain creates a feeling of confusion and frustration regarding its purpose (\textit{affective level}). However, the physical task of drawing the curtain aids in indicating the need for privacy (\textit{performative level}). So while the curtains themselves evoke a sense of a privacy-providing space, the sheer materials used may create an affective discord for the occupants. 

\subsubsection*{An Encouraging Staircase}
The building staircase shown in Figures \ref{fig:staircase} and \ref{fig:staircase-railing} was designed to inspire movement in the occupants. However, we find the cold and textured wrought iron discourages touching the railing(\textit{sensorial level}). The black, oversized, and floating structure casts a foreboding shadow on the onlooker (\textit{interpretive level}), and the brutalist design evokes a feeling of awe - something to observe, rather than use (\textit{affective level}). We find that the staircase may often fail to create a feeling of encouragement for occupants to use.

\subsubsection*{A Digital Interface to the Building}
A large screen in the building foyer (Figure \ref{fig:screen}) accompanied by an interactive interface is intended for users to explore and learn about the building. The interface is an interactive tablet that can be accessed by clicking and moving information around (\textit{sensorial level}). The screen presents itself a digital building attempting to be transparent and communicate with its occupants (\textit{interpretive level}). This placement triggers intrigue in learning more about the building (\textit{affective level}). However, we find that the limited information displayed prevents the device from becoming part of an occupant's daily practice (such as checking one's phone every morning) (\textit{performative level}). 

% Our proposed case study
\subsection{Our Ongoing Case Study} 
Towards understanding the impact of digital and non-digital materials on occupants in smart buildings, we are undertaking a preliminary case study in the aforementioned building. We aim to identify occupants' novel and subjective experiences that arise from interactions within the smart building. We are particularly interested in understanding experiences of occupant comfort (environmental) and emotions \cite{alavi2017comfort} which is key in built environments.  We wish to thereafter identify specific influential factors (tangible and intangible) that determine the overall sense of comfort and emotions in smart buildings spaces. The case study comprises two phases: (a) emotion and comfort label collection, and (b) building walk. First, we will conduct a short survey to obtain a large number of occupant emotion and comfort information based on different spaces in the building. Next, a building walk will be organised to obtain an in-depth understanding of occupants' perceptions - mental, emotional and physical towards different spaces in the building. During the walk, researchers will engage participants in conversations about each space. The conversations will follow the materials experience framework to understand the relationship between materials, occupants and practises within the different spaces of the building \cite{giaccardi2015foundations}. Questions will also investigate the four different experiential levels (sensory, interpretive, affective and performative). These include asking about impressions of the space, usage of space \textit{(How would you use this space? Why do you use this space? What kind of tasks would you perform in this space?)}, emotions in the space \textit{(What emotions do you associate with this space?)}, comfort \textit{(Is this space comfortable? Is there sufficient light, warmth, ventilation?)}, shortcomings and scope for improvement. Participants will also be encouraged to take photos of artefacts that stand out to them. Data collected from both phases will be analysed using thematic analysis, and lexical analysis \cite{braun2006using, xue2020mood}. 


% Expected outcomes that can inform B X M research - Material as a catalyst for human action
\subsection{Expected Contributions}
Through our case study, we aim to (among other goals) identify specific artefacts and the material properties of these artefacts that impact a smart buildings' occupants. Additionally, we expect to gain an understanding of the lived-in bodily comfort and emotional experiences within the building. We believe that our findings may help put forth considerations for designing for occupants' needs in smart buildings through the lens of the materials experiences framework. Our work is a preliminary step towards the design and development of materials that can help create experiences that occupants might find lacking in smart buildings (for eg., sense of autonomy and control in an automated building) \cite{moreno2014user}, or enhance certain other experiences (for eg., feelings of groundedness and familiarity in a space used by many) \cite{rehman2022personalisedcomfort}.  For example, the privacy curtains (Section \ref{subsec:building}, Figures \ref{fig:curtain} and \ref{fig:curtain-sheer}) could be better envisioned as a smart fabric that can intelligently transform from sheer to fully opaque to in-situ cater to varying privacy needs. Alternatively, materiality of objects could be expanded to materiality of space that in-situ infers occupants (negative) affective states, and attempts to alter it through means of empathic responses. 

We ultimately envision a design philosophy for architecture of the digital era that allows material-occupant experiences to shape technology and the ``smartness" of the space. We wish to use our case study to initiate a discussion about creating material-occupant experiences in architecture.


\section{Conclusion}
Digitisation of the architectural landscape in recent years can be attributed to a growing expectation for buildings to adapt to changing socio-environmental and technological needs. Materials that encompass such built spaces and the occupants that inhabit such spaces face a novel relationship. Given the inevitable growth of smart buildings, in this position paper, we suggest that the materials of a space can play a central role in understanding and shaping occupants' experiences towards more human-centric smart buildings. We discuss how materials (both tangible and intangible) of smart buildings can be examined, understood, and thereby designed for occupants' subjective needs and experiences following the materials experiences framework. To that end, we highlight an ongoing case study to identify the impact of one such smart building and its artefacts (tangible and intangible) on the occupants and therefore needs rethinking and redesign such that they may serve as catalysts for improved human well being.
